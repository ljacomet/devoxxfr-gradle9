=== Faster compilation
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

=== What is compilation avoidance?

image::myapp-recompile-diff.png[]

=== Compilation avoidance in practice
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

* Since Gradle 3.4 (Feb 2017)
* No recompilation between projects if ABI did not change
* Smaller compilation classpath thanks to `api`/`implementation` separation

=== Can it go faster?

=== Compiler daemons
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

* Reuse the Java compiler process across tasks and builds
* Active by default since Gradle 8.4
* Kotlin and Scala have their own support for this

=== What's up with 8.0 vs 8.1?

=== Gradle build anatomy

[.small.right.top-margin]
Bars not to scale

=== Configuration phase
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

* Apply plugins
* Execute build logic
* Compute task graph
** Selecting and configuring _requested_ tasks
** and their _dependencies_

=== Caching build configuration
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

image::config-cloud.png[]

=== What is cached?

[%step]
* Task graph
* Task inputs
* All the rest is discarded
** No `project` state anymore

=== Requirements
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

* No live JVM types
** Classloaders, I/O streams, threads, etc.
* No Gradle model types
** Including dependency management types

=== Example of invalid input
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

```kotlin
abstract class SomeTask : DefaultTask() {

    @get:Input lateinit var sourceSet: SourceSet

    @TaskAction
    fun action() {
        val classpathFiles = sourceSet.compileClasspath.files
        // ...
    }
}
```

needs to become

```kotlin
abstract class SomeTask : DefaultTask() {

    @get:InputFiles @get:Classpath
    abstract val classpath: ConfigurableFileCollection

    @TaskAction
    fun action() {
        val classpathFiles = classpath.files
        // ...
    }
}
```

configured with
```kotlin
classpath.from(sourceSet.compileClasspath)
```

=== Why does it matter?
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Configuration time goes down to almost zero
* Valid configuration cache gives stronger guarantees for task isolation
* Which allows Gradle tasks to run
[%step]
** sooner
** in parallel
** including inside a single project

=== Demo
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

=== Limitations
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* What about the work of the build engineer?
* What about dependency upgrades and other build focused engineering tasks?

=== Project isolation
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

=== Did you say cache miss?
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* On a miss, the configuration phase needs to run
* But, with enough guarantees, it could run
[%step]
** In parallel
** Incrementally

=== More constraints
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

* No _mutable_ cross project access during configuration
** Example: No `allprojects` or `subprojects` that _mutates_ project configuration

=== Current status
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

* Alpha experiment
* Interesting for early adopters
* Focuses on speeding up the IDE experience first
