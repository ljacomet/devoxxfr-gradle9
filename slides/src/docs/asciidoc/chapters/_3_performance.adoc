=== What is compilation avoidance?

image::myapp-recompile-diff.png[]

=== Compilation avoidance in practice
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

* Since Gradle 3.4 (Feb 2017)
* No recompilation between projects if ABI did not change
* Smaller compilation classpath thanks to `api`/`implementation` separation

=== Can it go faster?

=== Compiler daemons
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

* Reuse the Java compiler process across tasks and builds
* Active by default since Gradle 8.4
* Kotlin and Scala have their own support for this

=== What's up with 8.0 vs 8.1?

=== Gradle Configuration Cache
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

* The Configuration Cache is
[%step]
** a feature that significantly improves build performance
** by caching the result of the configuration phase
** and reusing this for subsequent builds.

=== Gradle Configuration Cache
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

* Enable it Today, it is *stable* since Gradle 8.1!
[%step]
** `--configuration-cache` on the command line
** `org.gradle.configuration-cache=true` +
   in your `gradle.properties`

=== Gradle build anatomy

[.small.right.top-margin]
*Bars not to scale*

=== Configuration phase
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

* Apply plugins
* Execute build logic
* Compute task graph
** Selecting and configuring _requested_ tasks
** and their _dependencies_

=== Caching build configuration

CONFIGURATION INPUTS
****

=== What is cached?

[%step]
* Task graph
* Task inputs
* All the rest is discarded
** No `project` state anymore

=== Requirements
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

* No live JVM types
** Classloaders, I/O streams, threads, etc.
* No Gradle model types
** Including dependency management types

[.small.right.top-margin]
link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html#config_cache:requirements[docs/configuration-cache-requirements]

=== Example of invalid input
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[source,kotlin]
----
abstract class SomeTask : DefaultTask() {

    @get:Input lateinit var sourceSet: SourceSet

    @TaskAction
    fun action() {
        val classpathFiles = sourceSet.compileClasspath.files
        // ...
    }
}
----

needs to become

[source,kotlin]
----
abstract class SomeTask : DefaultTask() {

    @get:InputFiles @get:Classpath
    abstract val classpath: ConfigurableFileCollection

    @TaskAction
    fun action() {
        val classpathFiles = classpath.files
        // ...
    }
}
----

configured with

[source,kotlin]
----
classpath.from(sourceSet.compileClasspath)
----

=== Why does it matter?
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Configuration time goes down to almost zero
* Valid configuration cache gives stronger guarantees for task isolation
* Which allows Gradle tasks to run
[%step]
** sooner
** in parallel
** including inside a single project

[background-color="#02303a"]
=== Demo
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

=== Can I use it on my build?
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* It depends on your build
* Most plugins out there are already compatible
* You can selectively declare incompatible tasks +
  [.small]#`tasks.some { notCompatibleWithConfigurationCache("because") }`#
* You may have to refactor custom build-logic
* This is about applying best practices anyway

[.notes]
****
* The amount of required work will heavily depend on the 3rd party plugins you use and the amount of custom build logic you have.

=== Configuration Cache Report

[%step]
* Useful to understand CC inputs
* Built-in
* image:cc-report-inputs.png[width=80%]

=== Configuration Cache Report
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Useful to understand CC problems
* Got much nicer in Gradle 8.7 with filtered exceptions
* image:cc-report-problems.png[]

=== Space Usage Analysis
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Useful if your cached state is too big
* External tool link:https://github.com/gradle/gcc2speedscope[gradle/gcc2speedscope]
* Helps identify "task state leaks"
* image:gcc2speedscope.png[width=80%]

=== What performance benefits?
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* It depends on your build
* It's not only about avoiding the configuration phase
* All tasks will run in parallel, always
* Configuration model memory can be freed
* Small builds will mostly benefit from more parallelism
* Large builds will also benefit from avoided configuration

=== What performance benefits?
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* For example: Square, on a *large* Android build
* Early adopters - link:https://developer.squareup.com/blog/5-400-hours-a-year-saving-developers-time-and-sanity-with-gradles/[Blog Post] - December 2022
* _Saving 5,400 hours a year with Gradle's Configuration Cache_
* _Recovering an estimated $1.1 million in lost productivity annually_

=== Limitations
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* What about the work of the build engineer?
* What about dependency upgrades and other build focused engineering tasks?

* Invalidation

=== Did you say cache miss?
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* On a miss, the configuration phase needs to run
* But, with no shared mutable state between projects, it could
[%step]
** Run in parallel
*** following the projects hierarchy
** Be cached incrementally
*** task sub-graphs cached per project

=== More constraints
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

* No _mutable_ cross project access during configuration
** Example: No `allprojects` or `subprojects` that _mutates_ project configuration

[.notes]
--
* Applying a plugin only on the root project

=== Progressive adoption
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Isolated Projects detects violations
* aka. configuration-coupling between projects
* Creating buckets of coupled projects
* Configuring and caching them in parallel and incrementally

=== Isolated Projects Status
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

* Alpha experiment on top of the Configuration Cache
* Interesting for early adopters
* Focuses on speeding up the IDE experience first

[.notes]
****
* We're really close to have IntelliJ and Gradle ready for early adopters
