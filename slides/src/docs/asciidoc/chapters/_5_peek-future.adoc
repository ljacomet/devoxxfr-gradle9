=== Peek at current prototype

```kotlin
kmpLibrary {
    dependencies {
        api(libs.ktor.client.core)
    }

    targets {
        jvm {
            jvmTarget = JvmTarget.JVM_14

            dependencies {
                api(libs.commons.lang)
            }
        }
        js {
            environment = JsEnvironment.NODE

            dependencies {
                implementation(libs.sqldelight.runtime)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Will certainly change, most likely a lot
