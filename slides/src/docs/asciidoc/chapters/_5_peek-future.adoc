🐘

=== Declarative Gradle
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

> The presence of code constructs in the software definition, such as variables, local methods and conditional expressions, makes it hard for software developers to work with the build.
>
> It also makes refactoring more difficult for the IDE and other tools to implement.

[.notes]
****
* While it has long been a best practice that build scripts should be declarative, and the build logic should be kept in plugins, this is not the reality for many projects.
* We’ve seen projects in the wild that mix declarative and imperative code and make build scripts that are long and complex.
* Gradle-specific concepts used in build scripts are not always familiar to software developers.
* This can make Gradle less approachable for developers unfamiliar with Gradle.
* At the same time, it makes it difficult for the IDEs to offer reliable support for editing build scripts.
